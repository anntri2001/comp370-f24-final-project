## Overview
Our team has been hired by a media company that wants to understand the news reporting currently happening around the film "Inside Out 2". They have indicated that they are especially concerned with visibility and reception relative to other movies that have come out at a similar time. Specifically, they want to know:

1. What aspect of the movie was the focus (topic) of the article?
2. How much coverage the movie received relative to other movies that came out at a similar time?

## Analysis Details
- Your analysis will draw on news articles drawn from NewsAPI.org.
- You should collect 500+ articles (total) on the movies you consider in your analysis
- Ensure to collect articles in a way that does not bias towards or against coverage volume of your selected movies
- You should set filters such that all 500 posts have a very high likelihood of being related to one of the movies AND are all in English
- To develop your topics, conduct an open coding on 200 articles (approach the exercise requireing each article to belong to exactly one topic)
- For your open and later codings, just use the title and opening of the article (i.e., you don't need to read the entire article)
- You should aim for between 3-8 topics in total
- Once your topics have been designed, manually annotate the entire set of the 500 articles in your dataset
- Characterize your topics by computing the 10 words in each category with the highest tf-idf scores (to comput inverse document freqeuncy, use all 500 posts that you originally collected)

## Question Formulation
- Box office vs streaming platforms
- Movie genre (children / cartoon), etc. - comedy
- Top rated / best movies
- looking at top Box Office films and collecting sentiment in posts
- which type of gross
